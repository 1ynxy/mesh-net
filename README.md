# mesh-net

Dissertation project on peer-to-peer network architectures for procedurally generated voxel worlds in C++.

When running on a headless server it must be run using a virtual framebuffer so that GLFW can initialise correctly.
This can be achieved using Xvfb.

## dependencies

- GLFW3
- GLM
- GLAD (INCLUDED)
- LODEPNG (INCLUDED)
